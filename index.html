                	<b>1 - What a Web Page is?</b><br>
			                  A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>2 - How Coding Works</b><br>
			                  Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
			                  <br>I'm &lt;b&gt; learning &lt;/b&gt; to code!<br>
			                  look like this:<br>
			                  I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b><br>
                  			Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").For example, if you forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <b>4- Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b><br>
                    			There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b><br>
                  			You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt; /p&gt;). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).
                    <li>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
                    <li>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;a href&#61;"www.udacity.com"&gt;
                </ul>

              HTML structure is similar to that of a family tree. By that the code can branch out to braches that alos branch out or may just be a sigle branch.

              The "C" is the most important part of the phrase. This styling will allow you to do an arrow of things from 
              changing color to changing size and spacing.
              You can use this to make formating and styling your page easier by using your setting for each time 
              you need something formated with these settings.  for example:
              <br><br>
              .description { atribute:style; } ex: .description { color:red;}
              <br><br>
              You can then use &lt;div class&#61;"description"&gt; for each time you want something with that style<br><br>
              Use CCS Style is setup to avoid repetition since you can set yo the exact look you want (Color, size, margins, effects, ect.)

              </ul>          
            <p>
              There is a newer way to set up using { box-sizing:border-box } that includes both border and padding in one setting.
              (drawback, older browsers may not display).  In order to overcome any potential issues you will need to add the following:
              <br><br>
              {   -webkit-box-sizing:border-box;<br>
              -moz-box-sizing:border-box;<br>
              -ms-box-sizing:border-box;<br>
              box-sizing:border-box;}<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Size of a box can be done by either number of pixcels (does not change size based on screen)
              or percentage (based on size of screen)
              <br>
              Ex: &lt;div class="description" style="<br>
              Width:50%<br>
              Height:50%;"><br>
              This will make the width and hight be only 50% of the screen size.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Positioning</b> can be accomplished by adding display: flex; to the appropriate CCS will override the behavior and let divs appear next to each other.

              Python is an interpreter that takes the written code and produces an output specific to the input or code written.  
              Specific instructions need to be given in order for Python to be able to produce an output.  If there is something 
              not clear (for example 2 + 2 +) then it does not have the ability to speculate what outcome your were looking for 
              (like 2 + 2).

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              In Python you use a &#61; to assinge a value to a variable.  For example
              <span class="code">name&#61;"Danny"</span>.  This would make is so that <span class="code">print name</span> would then give you an output of <span class="code">Danny</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also use this to create something like this:<br>
              <span class="code">first&#61;"Danny "<br>
                last&#61;"McCormick"<br>
                print first + last<br>
              </span>
              This would then give you an outcome of <span class="code">Danny McCormick</span>
            </p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              On the other hand if you assign the variable a number value like <span class="code">number&#61;2</span> and then did <span class="code">print number + number</span> you would get an outcome of <span class="code">4</span>.
              If you put quote marks around the variable like a number, it is no longer considered a number. So <span class="code">number&#61;&quot;2&quot;</span> and <span class="code">print number + number</span> you would get an outcome of <span class="code">22</span>.
            </p>
            <p> In Python saying something + something else does not always refer to actual addition as in math, but adding/combining two variables depending on what the variables values are.

          <p>
            What is a function in programing? A function takes an input and then produces an output.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to write this in start with keyword <span class="code">def</span> followed by a function name and the function paramater in parentheses.
            What is in the parentheses will end being replaced by the actual value in the function when it is used.<br>
            For example if you wanted to square of a number you could write the following:<br>
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            def square (x):<br>
              <span class="indent">answer &#61; x * x</span><br>
              <span class="indent">return answer</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            In order to use this function we would write the name of the fuction followed by the value we want to give it in parentheses.  like this:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            print square (4)<br>
            &gt;&gt;&gt;16

          <p>
            If there is does not have a return statement the you will get a result of <span class="code">None</span>.  Here is an example of what that would look like:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            def add two(x):<br>
            <span class="indent">answer &#61; x + 2</span>
            <br><br>

            <b> Retrun vs Print:</b> Without a 'return' statement the code really isn't doing anything even though it may print something out in text.  To make a function whole and complete you should end with a return statement.

            An if statement is used to determine which set of codes is to be used.  For example if x &#61; 5 then multiply by 10, else multiply by 2.  While loops on the other hand repeat until a criteria/condition is met.
            For example while the date is less than 15 add $2 to x. This code will continue until the date is no longer less than 15 and will continue to perform the function of adding $2..
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>&#61;&#61;(equals), !&#61; (doen't equal), &gt;, &lt;, &gt;&#61;, &lt;&#61;:</b> Are all Python comparison operations that would return a bolean value of True or False depending if the expression was true or not. For example, 10 !&#61; 100 would return a
            True since 10 does not equal 100.
            <li><b>if, then, else:</b> These would be used when you wanted to execute different operations
            depending on what the requirements were. For example if it's a weekday you want to charge $5, but on weekends you want to charge $10 you can use an if statement.
            <li><b>while loops:</b> This is used to repeat a function until that specific criteria is met, at which point you would stop. So while count is less than 100 execute count &#61; count + 5 and this will continue until the condition is met.

          <p>
            There are two key components when it comes to solving problems: <b>input</b> and <b>output</b>. Understanding the inputs and outputs of anything will help you better underdtand how it works and resolve any potention problem.  This is the same for coding and if you come accross any issue executing the code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Inputs:</b> Understanding the inputs that make up a code will help you better understand how to resolve if any issues happen on execution.
            <li><b>Outputs:</b> If you know what your code is actually suppose to do or your what your output should be, this will help if executing it has issues.</li>
          </ul>
            Knowing and understanding your inputs and outputs of any code are key to help determine any potential issue when the code does not work as expected.

            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is programming that defines the sturctue and type of data as well as the operations that will be applied to that data.  By doing this it becomes an object that not only contains data, but functions as well. We then have the ablity to create relationships between objects so that one object can inherit charateristics from another object. This allow you to follow the coders rule of reduce repetition.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Object-is any item that can be selected individually and then manipulated. (contains both data and procedures to manipulate the data)</b>-</li>
            <li><b>Library</b>-collection of compiled routines that a program can use</li>
            <li><b>Method</b>-a procedure that is executed when an object receives a message.  similar to a fuction, but a method is associated with a class.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Just like in HMTL where head emelements cantian data that is applied to other elements and CCS creates styles that can be used over and over, Phyton has classes that help to reduce/eleminate repition.  All of these help a code builder with the number one rule, Avoid repitition.
          </p>
          <p>
            OOP has many benefits especially when if comes to large projects.  One such benefit is the fact that it is modular.  What this allows us to do is reuse objects amongst other applications and then even expanded upon it to include new function.  Because of this it makes maintaining it easer since you can update individual components without have to update on a much larger scale.  Being able to reuse not only saves time, but cost as well since time is money.  Since fictionally does not have to be rewritten and time is saved more time is given to be able to insure a quality product is delivered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like I learned in my current position, when you are wasting time doing the smaller things like rewriting the same thing over and over or making mediocre changes that don’t change the quality of work being done, the less time you have to able to spend on the things that matter like enhancing code and thinking outside of the box for new potential code.  If we are able to recycle, enhance and reuse something that works than we need to do so.  Because like I am learning just showing someone the proper way to do something is not the same as automating part of it and being able to interpret those results and steer someone down the right path.  OOP allow us to work smarter and use time more wisely with the ability to reuse and tweak as needed. As stated before, time is money and we are all in the business to make money and safe time.  OOP allows us to do both at the same time.

            <b>Draw:</b> The turtle module is used to draw graphics.  Once imported it can be told what direction and how far to go.  For example turtle.foward(25) would draw a line as it moved forward 25 pixels.  You can also turn it with a command like turtle.rigth(90) which would make it turn 90 degrees.

            <b>Send Text:</b> Python can use an eternal library such as Twillow to send text messages.  This is done with the use of a <b>from__import__</b>.  We were able to create python code that from twilio we imported the rest so we could used that class to create an automated text message that looked like this:
          </p>
              <div class="codeblock">

            <b>Profanity Editor:</b> We were able to use built-in functions in Python to read documents and look for potential prohanity words we identified.  To do this we did an <b>import urllib</b> that would read a document on our computer that we provided the path to and a web site of prfanity words to see if any of the words in our document existed on that site.  If they did it would alert us that the document did in deed contain profanity. If it did not then it was safe to send it.

          <p>
            <b>Movie Website:</b> We then used the knowledge we gained to create a moive website of six of our favorite movies.  To do this we leaned the difference between <b>Class vs Instance</b>.  A <b>Class</b> would be the equvalenat to like the blueplint for a building and an <b>Instance</b> would be what was actually constructed or the building itself that was made from those blueprints.

            <b>More:</b> We also discovered that we can make things have <b>Inheritance</b> from a parent class.  So if you know something is going to be used again in lower levels then you can make this carry over.  So like in the examples we went over with the Movie class we relized the TVShow class would be able to inherit some of the things from the Movie class since they would be the same, like title and such.
